Similarly, the plan includes self-driving options from Evansville to South Bend and from South Bend to Key West due to the lack of direct flights on the specified dates and high taxi costs. The provided information does not include specific attractions or restaurants for some cities, so I chose the ones with the highest aggregate ratings."
